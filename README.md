# VideoViewPredictor
As YouTube transitions from hobby to career for creative professionals, creators increasingly rely on consistent revenue generated on the platform. As such, there is significant value in understanding the factors that contribute to making a video become trending on YouTube. The goal of our project is to create a model that predicts the number of views a video will accumulate before it is ever released by leveraging several regression algorithms on a feature set engineered from the predefined attributes of a video including title, tags, publish time, and description.
